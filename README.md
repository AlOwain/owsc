# OwSC

This is just some implementation of different sorting algorithms; it was originally written in C++ in satisfaction of Imam Mohammed Ibn Saud University's CS216 but has been extended and modified greatly since then by my desire to experiment with different sorting algorithms.

## Sorting A
The included sorting algorithms are:

- Stanley Fung's simple sort[^1]
- Gnome sort[^2]
- Insertion sort
- Bubble sort
- ~~Merge sort~~

Feel free to extend it, I will accept any implementation.

## TODO

- Implement Merge Sort
- Create macros to run the sorting functions
- Use Criterion to benchmark the sorting algorithms
- Create GUIs to visualize the sorting algorithms
